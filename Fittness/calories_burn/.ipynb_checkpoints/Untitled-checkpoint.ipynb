    "Now it's time to start developing the package. Specific expectations for this step are:\n",
    "- Set-up an appropriate directory structure (file and folder organization) for your package [2 marks].\n",
    "- Use Python to write the package that contains at least four useful functions. These are the functions you proposed in the previous step. [8 marks].\n",
    "    - Create a package with two subpackages. Each subpackage must have at least two modules and each module should have at least three methods/functions. Each member of the group is expected to do one of the subpackages. \n",
    "    - One module must use inheritance.\n",
    "    - The person who did not write a particular subpackage must write the documentation for the package as well as create a test Python file demonstrating how to use the package.\n",
    "- Write a .md file explaining the function details and how they work. Create a test Python file demonstrating how to use the package [2 marks].\n",
    "- Use version control features to collaborate with your team members. Have a Git history to demonstrates that the group members contributed equally [4 marks]."
